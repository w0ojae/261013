# Glass rain sources

This directory adapts the surface-water modules and two droplet sprites from
Over-the-Window. Its video, music, controls, pointer interaction, background
renderer and air-force calculations are excluded. The original quiet rainfall
baseline, droplet collisions, friction, path variation, deformation and trails
are retained, with fixed logical pane sizes and a bounded 30 Hz simulation.

Changes include app-driven clocks, CPU collision sharing, stateful moving heads,
shared deformation and trail masks, and projection onto world-space glass.
The original heart story, lightning, background media and audio are excluded.

## Codrops RainEffect

Rain & Water Effect Experiments by Lucas Bebber / Codrops.
Demo: https://tympanus.net/Development/RainEffect/
Source: https://github.com/codrops/RainEffect
License referenced by the original package:
https://tympanus.net/codrops/licensing/

The original `assets/drop-alpha.png` and `assets/drop-color.png` sprites are used.
Size-based release, spreading recovery, trail births, 80% radius-squared-area
merges, RGBA sprite composition and refraction formulas derive from RainEffect.
Over-the-Window adds mass-based fall speed, bounded populations, local friction
and adhesion, coherent path noise, shared deformation, rotation, and collisions
between Codrops droplets and the Heartfelt microtexture. This adaptation keeps
those surface-water behaviors and replaces the standalone renderer with the
cafe's Three.js window material.
